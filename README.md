As the first term of my PhD has come to its end, I finally got some time for proper research. I want to pick up GitHub as a first thing before starting to extend my code for SPCA since the code I developed over the past 1.5 years has gone a bit messy. I really need a way of organising them better - version control is the natural thing to learn about and adopt.
